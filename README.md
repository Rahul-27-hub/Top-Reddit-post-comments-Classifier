# Top-Reddit-post-comments-Classifier
You can download the dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushar5harma/topredditcomments
For this to work make sure you put them in the same directory.
We have implemented Knn, LogisticRegression, Multinomial Naives Bayes, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression(Scratch) and Decision Tree.
There are some issues in Naive Bayes, since it takes a lot of time to train the classifier there might be some logical errors.
